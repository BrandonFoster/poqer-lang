POQER: Prolog Object Queries, Entries, and Relations

## Creator
My name is Brandon Foster. I use logic programming as a part of my cs research.<br>
My fields of interests are mathematics, logic programming, and graphics programming.

## About
POQER is a logic programming language that follows from the syntax of prolog.<br>
This programming language is created as a hobby project and has no plans of being official in anyway of the word.<br>
If anybody finds joy in using/copying/modifying/breaking the programming language, thanks.

## Goals
Goals that are in mind for this programming language are as follows:
- [x] 1A. A Lexical Analyzer Supporting Prolog Tokens (Conforms to the ISO/IEC 13211-1)
- [ ] 1B. A Syntax Grammar Supporting Prolog Syntax (Conforms to the ISO/IEC 13211-1)
- [ ] 2A. An Embedded POQER C Library
- [ ] 2B. A Windows & Linux CLI Interpreter
- [ ] 2C. A Windows & Linux Compiler
- [ ] 3A. Example Programs Involving Simple Games & Puzzles
- [ ] 4A. An IDE For Better Program Organization
- [ ] 4B. A Visual Studio Code Syntax Highlighter
- [ ] Future goals goes here...

### Currently Working On: 1A, 1B, 2A, & 2B
